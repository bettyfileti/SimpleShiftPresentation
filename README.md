# SimpleShiftPresentation
A video presentation tool that allows you to easily toggle between the video of yourself and your slide deck. Slides can be shown in a minimal "news anchor" view or full-screen. The goal of this program is to allow a person to present a presentation with more confidence. A presentor can easily shift between full speaker view and sharing the screen with a presentation deck, allowing them to better "control the room."


This is an app created in OpenFrameworks and Xcode. 
Once running, drag images in alphabetical order and drop on top of the video screen. Use the up/down arrow keys on your keyboard to toggle between video displays. Use the left/right arrows to cycle through your slides. Press "m" to make the speaker window move with the mouse.

Next steps include:
Product Design --> Come up with slide dimensions solution (What happens with slides of different sizes, or should it encourage users to always have the same sized slides?),  Drag and Drop interface (Design something nicer here, and work to ensure accessibility), Really think through the arrow controls (perhaps allow forward/backward motion always or at least after the deck has been gone through once?)

Development --> Can you make this work so a user can drag a folder of images? What about a single pdf?, Move the mouse-move functionality to the newscaster view, Lock the preso in place after moving the newscaster view
